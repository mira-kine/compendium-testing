# Planning

## What I need to start

- [x] API
- [ ] Behavioral test suite -> user can perform at least one action to manipulate app state
- [ ] Component test suite -> compendium items display
- [ ] renders at least 10 items

### Services

- [x] fetchFish
- [ ] fetchFishByType

### Components - where to render

- [ ] FishList - renders list of items on page load

### Views - where states live

- [ ] fish, setFish
- [ ] color, setColor
